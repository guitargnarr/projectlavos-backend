## What Was NOT Changed (Intentionally Kept)

### Sections Preserved:
- ✅ Current Reality (age, background, philosophy) - Timeless
- ✅ Live Projects - Updated status, kept structure
- ✅ System Architecture - Stable, no changes needed
- ✅ How to Help Me - Preferences unchanged
- ✅ Proven Deployment Workflow - Working process
- ✅ Monorepo Architecture - Current structure
- ✅ Job Search Tracking - Still relevant for dual-track strategy
- ✅ Infrastructure notes - MCP tools, CLI inventory

### Why Kept These:
- High value for future Claude Code sessions
- Provide essential context
- Not outdated (still accurate)
- Concise enough (no bloat to remove)

---

## What Was Removed (Bloat Reduction)

**None.** The original CLAUDE.md was already well-organized at 1,516 lines. The ULTRATHINK analysis predicted 3,800 lines of bloat, but actual file was concise.

**Strategy:** Add new information without removing working sections.

---

## Validation Checklist

**Questions the Updated CLAUDE.md Answers:**
- ✅ What's Matthew working on? (projectlavos, 4 demos, consulting pivot)
- ✅ What's the current status? (Restaurant Analyzer complete, 4 demos live)
- ✅ What's next? (Email Scorer, testing, LinkedIn update)
- ✅ What works? (Manual Vercel deployment, backend API, positioning)
- ✅ What needs attention? (Testing, Email Scorer, marketing prep)
- ✅ What's the strategic positioning? (10-Hour Question framework)
- ✅ What's the QA status? (B grade, low risk, testing pending)

**Questions It Should NOT Answer:**
- ❌ Detailed commit history (Git is source of truth)
- ❌ Step-by-step implementation (already done, historical)
- ❌ Resolved troubleshooting (no longer relevant)

---

## Future Maintenance Strategy

### After Each Session:
1. Update "Current State" section (lines 1604-1609)
2. Update "Week X Progress" section (lines 1611-1615)
3. Update "Next Action" (line 1619)
4. Add new "Recent Work" section if significant feature completed
5. Archive old "Recent Work" sections after 30 days

### Monthly Cleanup:
- Move resolved issues to archive
- Condense "Recent Work" sections older than 4 weeks
- Verify all links/references still accurate
- Remove outdated timelines

### Goal:
- Keep CLAUDE.md under 2,000 lines
- Focus on present state + immediate future
- Archive historical details
